# GRIDmas Tree Web
 PLEASE NOTE! This project is not an official GRIDmas tree project (as of yet, but who knows). So it probably won't be fully functional!
 
 A web-based simulator for the GRIDmas Tree project.

This is what the proejct looks like as of 05/01/2025. The tree looks a bit weird, because I haven't figured out how to properly convert the values in tree.csv into X,Y,Z coordinates. But all 500 of the mini GRIDmas tree lights are on it.
